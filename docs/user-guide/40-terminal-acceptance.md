# Physical terminal acceptance and recovery

Section: Business Admin
Roles: Admin for final acceptance; Manager/Admin can perform most checks
Permission: system.configure, backup.create, backup.restore

## Overview

Patch 10 is the final installed-terminal rehearsal. It does not certify a theoretical build or a browser preview. Evidence belongs to the specific native terminal, database schema and local installation.

The acceptance panel records local immutable evidence in `terminal_acceptance_evidence`. These rows are not business records, are not added to the transactional outbox, and cannot be edited or deleted.

Final acceptance requires:

- SQLite schema v11 and `PRAGMA quick_check = ok`;
- `LIVE` installation stage;
- terminal identity present;
- cloud synchronization configured;
- zero pending outbox operations;
- no open till;
- no queued or delivery-uncertain printer jobs;
- current-schema backup/restore rehearsal;
- native process restart recovery;
- offline local-database rehearsal;
- reconnect/cloud synchronization evidence;
- physical printer/scanner/drawer evidence when those devices were declared during Intake.

## Before starting

Close active service and settle/close the till. Do not perform final acceptance during live customer trading.

If hardware was declared incorrectly during Intake, correct the deployment plan rather than recording false evidence.

## Procedure

Complete the acceptance checks below on the actual installed native terminal. Work through the terminal doctor, backup/restore rehearsal, declared hardware checks, restart recovery, offline rehearsal, reconnect/cloud recovery, then Admin-only final acceptance. A check is complete only when ServOS records the corresponding immutable evidence and the current blocker list is clear.

## Terminal doctor

On the Windows terminal, run:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\servos-terminal-doctor.ps1
```

Optionally persist the read-only report:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\servos-terminal-doctor.ps1 -OutputPath .\terminal-doctor.json
```

The doctor does not change Windows settings. It reports OS/architecture, RAM, free system-drive space, timezone/UTC offset, print-spooler state, installed printers, active network adapters and the active power scheme.

The baseline checks are:

- 64-bit OS;
- at least 4 GB RAM;
- at least 5 GB free system-drive space;
- UTC+03:00 local offset for Nairobi/Kenya;
- Windows Print Spooler running.

A stronger production terminal can exceed these minimums.

## Backup and restore rehearsal

Choose **Run backup rehearsal**.

ServOS:

1. creates a real SQLite online backup;
2. copies that backup to a temporary rehearsal-restore file;
3. opens the rehearsal copy read-only;
4. runs `PRAGMA quick_check`;
5. compares schema version;
6. compares terminal identity;
7. compares records, commands, audit and outbox row counts;
8. opens the temporary restore as a writable ServOS database;
9. commits one temporary customer command twice with the same command ID and verifies exact idempotent replay;
10. reruns SQLite quick-check on the writable restored copy;
11. removes the temporary rehearsal copy;
12. keeps the real backup;
13. records immutable acceptance evidence only when every comparison succeeds.

The live business database is never replaced by the rehearsal copy.

## Receipt printer

Choose **Send test slip**.

Transport success alone is not physical proof. LAN TCP and the Windows spooler cannot tell ServOS whether paper actually emerged.

Inspect the printer. Only choose **Paper observed** when the ServOS XP-80T test slip physically exists.

A `DELIVERY_UNCERTAIN` transport can still pass this check if the operator can physically see the printed slip. A queued job cannot.

Final acceptance also requires zero unresolved printer jobs.

## Barcode scanner

Choose **Arm scanner test**, then scan a test barcode/tag with the configured keyboard-wedge scanner.

The normal scanner hook must identify the wedge scan. Acceptance stores only:

- keyboard-wedge capture type;
- captured character count;
- `rawValueStored = false`.

The scanned content itself is not retained.

## Cash drawer

ServOS currently has no direct native cash-drawer adapter.

If Intake declares a cash drawer, physically test the drawer and normal cashier workflow manually. The acceptance panel makes this limitation explicit and records a manual observation only after operator confirmation.

Do not interpret this evidence as ServOS-generated drawer pulse control.

## Native restart recovery

Choose **Begin restart test**.

ServOS stores the current process nonce locally.

Then:

1. close the native ServOS application completely;
2. relaunch ServOS;
3. sign in again;
4. return to Business Admin;
5. choose **Confirm restart recovery**.

Confirmation is rejected inside the original process. It requires a different startup nonce, which proves that a new native process opened the existing database. Sessions are already cleared at native startup, so sign-in is also exercised.

## Offline rehearsal

Disconnect the terminal's network connection.

Do not merely close a browser tab or turn off cloud synchronization. The native webview must report `navigator.onLine = false`.

When **Run offline probe** becomes available, use it.

ServOS then verifies SQLite quick-check, reads the current local record set and commits a local acceptance-evidence row while networking is unavailable. This verifies that local database access does not depend on cloud reachability.

Reconnect networking afterward.

## Reconnect and cloud recovery

After reconnecting, choose **Sync and verify recovery**.

The panel:

1. runs normal ServOS synchronization;
2. requires configured cloud synchronization;
3. requires a successful `last_sync` within 15 minutes;
4. requires zero unacknowledged outbox rows;
5. records `CLOUD_RESYNC` evidence.

Cloud recovery evidence must be newer than the offline rehearsal evidence.

## Final acceptance

Final acceptance is Admin-only.

The button remains disabled until all current blockers are gone.

Final evidence snapshots:

- schema version;
- terminal identity;
- SQLite quick-check result;
- required acceptance evidence list;
- zero pending outbox state.

The final evidence is point-in-time deployment acceptance. Later application/schema upgrades should run the acceptance procedure again.

## Failure rules

Do not work around a failed acceptance item by editing SQLite, deleting evidence, changing tests or marking unavailable hardware as passed.

Fix the underlying condition and rerun the relevant check.

Typical blockers include:

- cloud not configured;
- pending outbox;
- open till;
- unresolved printer job;
- restart challenge not completed;
- backup rehearsal from an older schema;
- missing physical hardware evidence.

## Power interruption and printer ambiguity

A forced operating-system power cut is not automated by ServOS because deliberately corrupting or interrupting a production machine is unsafe.

The acceptance suite instead verifies native-process restart recovery plus SQLite integrity. Existing printer startup logic already changes a job left in `SENDING` to `DELIVERY_UNCERTAIN`, requiring the operator to check paper before retrying. This avoids duplicate receipts after interruption.

For site commissioning, an installer may additionally perform a controlled UPS/power-loss rehearsal on a disposable/pre-production database image, never on the only production copy.
