## Overview

Front Desk is the operational view over the native Rooms engine. It combines today's arrivals and departures, occupied-room counts, search, a multi-day tape chart, check-in, and room moves.

The screen uses the business hotel timezone `Africa/Nairobi`. Reservation availability still comes from the native backend, including turnaround buffers and room blocks.

Check-in creates the stay and, when one does not already exist, a zero-value folio shell using the reservation ID as the stable ID. Room moves preserve the reservation rate snapshot, dirty the old room, and create a turnaround block.

Paid extensions and checkout remain disabled until Patch 07 Folios because they require accommodation posting, deposits, payment evidence, and zero-balance conservation.

## Procedure

### Review arrivals

1. Open **Front Desk**.
2. Review **Arrivals today**.
3. Confirm that the arrival time has been reached.
4. Confirm that the assigned room is `CLEAN` and not `OUT_OF_ORDER`.
5. Choose **Check in**.

The backend rechecks reservation and room versions, room cleanliness, room condition, timing, and interval availability before committing.

### Review departures

The **Departures today** queue shows active reservations whose planned departure falls on the current Nairobi hotel date.

Checkout remains unavailable until Patch 07. Do not simulate checkout by cancelling a checked-in reservation or manually changing room state.

### Use the tape chart

Choose a start date and a seven- or fourteen-day view. Each row is a room. Reservation cells show reserved or checked-in occupancy. Block cells show active availability blocks.

Turnaround time is included in reservation occupancy for availability even when the displayed departure has passed.

### Move an in-house guest

1. Choose **Move** on a checked-in stay.
2. Select a clean, available room with enough guest capacity.
3. Record the reason.
4. Confirm the move.

ServOS checks versions for the stay, reservation, current room, and destination room. It updates reservation and stay together, marks the old room dirty, preserves the existing rate snapshot, and adds a turnaround block for the old room.

### Handle conflicts

A version conflict means another committed action changed the reservation, stay, or room after the screen loaded. Refresh the Front Desk and repeat the action using the current data.
